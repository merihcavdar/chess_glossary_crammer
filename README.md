# Chess Glossary Crammer
I have developed this App in Flutter using Sqlite for offline database and async functions to retrieve/write data from/to it.

This App consits of the following sections:
* Search: Also the main screen in which you can search for a term. (see the screenshot below.) As you typed, the results are filtered to find the word easily. 
* Quiz: You can test your chess term knowledge in this multiple choice quiz. You are presented a definition and you try to choose the correct term from the 3 options.
* Flashcards: When you do not have a specific chess term in mind, just tap on the refresh button for a random chess term and its definition.
* History: All the chess terms you searched for are listed here in the order of date.

Thank you for taking your time to review my code.
